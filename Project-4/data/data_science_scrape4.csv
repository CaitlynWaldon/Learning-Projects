If so, this opportunity may be for you. At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.

At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.

You will work within a team of data scientists, statisticians and engineers. Your particular expertise and passion, however, is in modern deep learning methods applied to computer vision. You’re capable of moving well beyond pre-trained keras models, eager and capable of coming up with custom architectures to take advantage of our rich data set of 2D, multi-view and 3D data.

A bit more about the culture…

At Nearmap, every opinion matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact. Our Nearmappers see the world differently and are intently focused on delivering the best location content in the world. Having a shared goal and a lot of fun reaching it is how our Nearmappers truly flourish at their home away from home. We're all super down-to-earth - except when we're in the sky capturing fresh imagery!

More about what you need to bring…

The main attributes we're after are:

Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of deep learning and computer is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to apply machine learning, but some solid experience doing it within the realm of imagery and conv nets. Experience with Keras, Tensorflow, 2D, multi-view and 3D data are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research) working with imagery.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills https://www.dropbox.com/s/tw1y3dc32e6la5h/test.tar.gz?dl=0

As their Data Science function (which is building a reputation for delivering real advantages within the business) continues to grow and I am looking for experienced Data Science & Data Insights hires to join their team.

I am looking for candidates from either a Software Engineering/Machine Learning background or those from either a Data Science or more traditional Statistical/ Predictive Modelling background who have fluent programming skills (Python and R are essential) and typically have strong academics in a relevant discipline (BSc, MSc, PhD Data Science, Statistics, Actuarial, Computer Science et al) and who wish to join a high performing team involved in practically every aspect/business function possible and are regarded as increasingly essential to business improvement.
My clients Advanced Analytics/Data Science team add value across the entire business - Finance, Operations etc. but there is a real focus on Sales & Marketing - looking at customer acquisition, retention, CLV, segementation, campaigns, lead generation, conversion rates from different sources (e.g. radio & TV advertisements, Social Media - Facebook etc., Email Marketing, Text Marketing etc.) so a candidate well versed in SEM and Data Science for B2C ecommerce, online sales generation etc. woiuld be extremely well regarded. Culturally my client is an online sales business that specialises in Financial Services.
I am looking for candidates with a strong Engineering and QA focus - who can build API's that are easily changed & you will need to see the bigger picture, connect the dots about how API's you build may evolve and change over time and have the ability to engineer something with an appreciation that it will be changed, enhanced, altered etc in the future so I am looking for candidates who bring those Software ""Engineering"" qualities to the table.
If you are a Data Scientist who could also walk into a high performing Senior Insights role with a Consulting firm (eg, presentation skills, customer engagement, strategy and planning, insights to find opportunities, drive sales etc.) and want to work client-side then this is worthy of your consideration.
Working with other Data Scientists, specialist 3rd party teams & key stakeholders, your core role will involve the design, development, testing and deployment of analytically focused algorithms designed to solve business problems. Your tool-kit to deliver on this will include methods and techniques such as Data Visualisation, Natural Language Processing, Statistical & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
This role requires a strong coding focus so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this.
The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems.
This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena. Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.
Any candidates with experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
My client offers a first class working environment – professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.
In short, this is one of the finest Data Science related opportunities you will see in Sydney in 2019. Strong & innovative leadership, a superb work culture and environment, fabulous opportunities for progression given the company trajectory/ pace of growth & the ability to make a meaningful contribution/have a tangible impact on a day to day basis makes this role seriously not to be missed.

We entered the market in 2011 with the vision of defining the future of fashion retail. Since then we have created a brand known throughout Australia by connecting 20-35yr old shoppers with the best fashion and sports product through the most inspiring and rewarding shopping experience.

THE ICONIC stands for benchmark-setting experiences (3HR delivery, access to over 700 top brands, market-leading shopping app), for impassioned communities (connecting Australians fashion and sports lovers through digital innovation), and for our love of the newest in fashion from our 700+ leading local and international brands. We want to inspire Australians and New Zealanders to constantly explore new sides of their identity, and have a whole lot of fun doing it.


""We Dream Big"" – you will challenge the status quo, bringing passion, innovation and creativity to the wider ICONIC team.
""We Are True to our Customers"" – you will be inherently passionate about customer impact, both external and internal customers, and will constantly challenge yourself and the team to deliver more customer value.
""We Get Things Done"" – you do not want to work in a cumbersome organisation, you want to work in an agile high-growth company. You lead with the right balance of planning and pragmatism.
""We are Stronger Together"" - you will be part of an experienced team working collaboratively to inspire the broader organisation towards a united vision.

About the Tech Team

We are as much a technology business as we are fashion, so here you will find a fast-paced, innovative, senior level Tech team who live and breathes code every day.

All our tech people work in hierarchy free cross-functional squads, that act like startups inside a larger company. The squads are mission driven and responsible to come up with projects that allows the mission to succeed. Each squad owns each project from inception to deploy without dependencies or approvals.

A typical squad at THE ICONIC has between 8 to 10 people each with different main skill-sets ie: Full stack engineer, iOS, Android, Product Owner, Data Scientist, UXD etc… Because of this you'll have the opportunity to learn other skills and cross-pollinate your main skill to others.

To keep everyone in sync we have several guilds where people discuss and align specific practices ie PHP, Data, Javascript, Python, Platforms, UX, Security etc… We also run a fortnightly show & tell where our 9 squads present achievements, failures and learnings.

We believe innovation is everyone's job, by having mission driven squads innovation happens naturally. We love to challenge the status quo and that's why we have a monthly Pet Project Day to give everyone the opportunity to improve and innovate on tech and process using tools they are curious about.

Learning is at the base of our culture. We have a shared learning fund for everyone to use with minimal friction. We also run a monthly Learning Day where everyone pairs up to learn and teach cool tech.

About the Role

We are looking for a highly engaged platforms engineer with strong passion for cloud and containerisation technologies who wants to work on a varied technology stack. You ideally know your way around Kubernetes, Docker and Rancher to manage a container heavy stack. You also believe in LEAN engineering methodologies and believe our mantra of infrastructure as code.

What will I be working on?


Platform architecture and engineering for THE ICONIC's infrastructure
Implement new customer build pipelines to increase the iteration speed of our engineers
Driving innovation by coming up with new and surprising ideas
Providing feedback and constructive criticism to improve our application design, usability and interaction

If so, this opportunity may be for you. At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.

At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.

While you know about Machine Learning and Data Science, you are at heart a software engineer with a passion for data. You will work as part of the AI Systems team to build internal infrastructure and tools, including RESTful APIs, databases, data pipelines, and deploying deep learning models at scale. You’ll be someone who thrives in a diverse team, working shoulder-to-shoulder with data scientists, statisticians, and other engineers.

A bit more about the culture…

At Nearmap, every opinion matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact. Our Nearmappers see the world differently and are intently focused on delivering the best location content in the world. Having a shared goal and a lot of fun reaching it is how our Nearmappers truly flourish at their home away from home. We're all super down-to-earth - except when we're in the sky capturing fresh imagery!

More about what you need to bring…

We're after an exceptional data scientist / machine learning engineer, who has the ability to deliver an end-to-end project, but will also value the opportunity to be mentored by the more experienced members of the team.

The main attributes we're after are:

Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of software engineering best practices is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to write clean code, but the ability to engineer complex software systems to support training and deployment of machine learning models on massive data sets. Experience with Kubernetes, Golang, Docker and cloud are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research).
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).
Some of our perks include…

Competitive pay, commission plan and Employee Share Scheme
Flexible working environment, work life balance is a necessity
Opportunities for continued career growth and development
Ergonomic workstations with sit stand desks
Fortnightly massages
Free reign of Nearmap’s products
