As their Data Science function (which is building a reputation for delivering real advantages within the business) continues to grow and I am looking for experienced Data Science & Data Insights hires to join their team.

I am looking for candidates from either a Software Engineering/Machine Learning background or those from either a Data Science or more traditional Statistical/ Predictive Modelling background who have fluent programming skills (Python and R are essential) and typically have strong academics in a relevant discipline (BSc, MSc, PhD Data Science, Statistics, Actuarial, Computer Science et al) and who wish to join a high performing team involved in practically every aspect/business function possible and are regarded as increasingly essential to business improvement.
My clients Advanced Analytics/Data Science team add value across the entire business - Finance, Operations etc. but there is a real focus on Sales & Marketing - looking at customer acquisition, retention, CLV, segementation, campaigns, lead generation, conversion rates from different sources (e.g. radio & TV advertisements, Social Media - Facebook etc., Email Marketing, Text Marketing etc.) so a candidate well versed in SEM and Data Science for B2C ecommerce, online sales generation etc. woiuld be extremely well regarded. Culturally my client is an online sales business that specialises in Financial Services.
I am looking for candidates with a strong Engineering and QA focus - who can build API's that are easily changed & you will need to see the bigger picture, connect the dots about how API's you build may evolve and change over time and have the ability to engineer something with an appreciation that it will be changed, enhanced, altered etc in the future so I am looking for candidates who bring those Software ""Engineering"" qualities to the table.
If you are a Data Scientist who could also walk into a high performing Senior Insights role with a Consulting firm (eg, presentation skills, customer engagement, strategy and planning, insights to find opportunities, drive sales etc.) and want to work client-side then this is worthy of your consideration.
Working with other Data Scientists, specialist 3rd party teams & key stakeholders, your core role will involve the design, development, testing and deployment of analytically focused algorithms designed to solve business problems. Your tool-kit to deliver on this will include methods and techniques such as Data Visualisation, Natural Language Processing, Statistical & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
This role requires a strong coding focus so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this.
The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems.
This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena. Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.
Any candidates with experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
My client offers a first class working environment – professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.
In short, this is one of the finest Data Science related opportunities you will see in Sydney in 2019.

Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016 by
Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million grant
from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six SCIEX mass
spectrometers and a super computer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes tumour
samples through a proteomic method, SWATH-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric
conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file
representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of the goals of ProCan is to
measure thousands of proteins in about 70,000 cancers of all types with known treatment
outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data
Science Group aims to develop novel computational tools and sophisticated machine
learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big
proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association
analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying cancer, 3) development of advanced

THE ICONIC stands for benchmark-setting experiences (3HR delivery, access to over 700 top brands, market-leading shopping app), for impassioned communities (connecting Australians fashion and sports lovers through digital innovation), and for our love of the newest in fashion from our 700+ leading local and international brands. We want to inspire Australians and New Zealanders to constantly explore new sides of their identity, and have a whole lot of fun doing it.


""We Dream Big"" – you will challenge the status quo, bringing passion, innovation and creativity to the wider ICONIC team.
""We Are True to our Customers"" – you will be inherently passionate about customer impact, both external and internal customers, and will constantly challenge yourself and the team to deliver more customer value.
""We Get Things Done"" – you do not want to work in a cumbersome organisation, you want to work in an agile high-growth company. You lead with the right balance of planning and pragmatism.
""We are Stronger Together"" - you will be part of an experienced team working collaboratively to inspire the broader organisation towards a united vision.

About the Tech Team

We are as much a technology business as we are fashion, so here you will find a fast-paced, innovative, senior level Tech team who live and breathes code every day.

All our tech people work in hierarchy free cross-functional squads, that act like startups inside a larger company. The squads are mission driven and responsible to come up with projects that allows the mission to succeed. Each squad owns each project from inception to deploy without dependencies or approvals.

A typical squad at THE ICONIC has between 8 to 10 people each with different main skill-sets ie: Full stack engineer, iOS, Android, Product Owner, Data Scientist, UXD etc… Because of this you'll have the opportunity to learn other skills and cross-pollinate your main skill to others.

To keep everyone in sync we have several guilds where people discuss and align specific practices ie PHP, Data, Javascript, Python, Platforms, UX, Security etc… We also run a fortnightly show & tell where our 9 squads present achievements, failures and learnings.

We believe innovation is everyone's job, by having mission driven squads innovation happens naturally. We love to challenge the status quo and that's why we have a monthly Pet Project Day to give everyone the opportunity to improve and innovate on tech and process using tools they are curious about.

Learning is at the base of our culture. We have a shared learning fund for everyone to use with minimal friction. We also run a monthly Learning Day where everyone pairs up to learn and teach cool tech.

About the Role

We are looking for a highly engaged platforms engineer with strong passion for cloud and containerisation technologies who wants to work on a varied technology stack. You ideally know your way around Kubernetes, Docker and Rancher to manage a container heavy stack. You also believe in LEAN engineering methodologies and believe our mantra of infrastructure as code.

Implement new customer build pipelines to increase the iteration speed of our engineers
Driving innovation by coming up with new and surprising ideas
Providing feedback and constructive criticism to improve our application design, usability and interaction

If so, this opportunity may be for you. At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.

At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.

While you know about Machine Learning and Data Science, you are at heart a software engineer with a passion for data. You will work as part of the AI Systems team to build internal infrastructure and tools, including RESTful APIs, databases, data pipelines, and deploying deep learning models at scale. You’ll be someone who thrives in a diverse team, working shoulder-to-shoulder with data scientists, statisticians, and other engineers.

A bit more about the culture…

At Nearmap, every opinion matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact. Our Nearmappers see the world differently and are intently focused on delivering the best location content in the world. Having a shared goal and a lot of fun reaching it is how our Nearmappers truly flourish at their home away from home. We're all super down-to-earth - except when we're in the sky capturing fresh imagery!

More about what you need to bring…

We're after an exceptional data scientist / machine learning engineer, who has the ability to deliver an end-to-end project, but will also value the opportunity to be mentored by the more experienced members of the team.

The main attributes we're after are:

Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of software engineering best practices is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to write clean code, but the ability to engineer complex software systems to support training and deployment of machine learning models on massive data sets. Experience with Kubernetes, Golang, Docker and cloud are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research).
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).
Some of our perks include…

Competitive pay, commission plan and Employee Share Scheme
Flexible working environment, work life balance is a necessity
Opportunities for continued career growth and development
Ergonomic workstations with sit stand desks
Fortnightly massages
Free reign of Nearmap’s products
Free healthy breakfast, snacks & lunches available in our kitchen with water views
An allowance to help you focus on your well being

With a well-established Analytics function that has the scope to influence each and every part of the business in the quest to improve customer satisfaction, improve ROI and the bottom line you will be joining a high performing team who will encourage you to adopt a high-ownership culture and push you to really grow as a Data Analyst.

The work is varied and interesting and can touch upon most aspects of the business ( sales/contact centre, finance, operations, marketing etc) though initially you can expect to learn about the different data assets and most likely get involved in building dashboards, reporting, looking at basic insights etc, potentially at automating aspects where possible etc. so I am really looking for candidates who have some fluency with regards to coding (writing with R, C, Python etc) and ideally have some experience with SQL as a building block of understanding data (stored procedures, packages, triggers) as this will enable you to be able to add real value quickly.
In terms of academics, I have a strong preference for MORSE (Maths, Stats, Operations Research, Economics etc.) or Actuarial related/Pricing related qualifications or STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) related academics. In addition to strong academics/good intellectual horse-power I need candidates to have had some experience of work in the real-world. The process here requires you to complete a problem solving test and if you have no grasp of business then this could be problematic so any experience in retail, services etc. could prove useful.
Candidates with some commercial experience will also be considered but this needs to be ideally honed in a Data&Analytics related role and you will need to possess solid coding skills (e.g. R, Python, SQL, SAS etc.)
This is a role where dealing with messy, unstructured data is a daily challenge and with new initiatives into Speech & Text Analytics then this will be expected to increase so some experience and capability with SQL would be highly regarded.
You will interrogate these data assets to build models to improve results across the business and also over time be expected to help provide the business with meaningful insights around the data and turn it into information to drive business decisions.
This is a high profile role where strong performance will be recognised and your work will be strongly linked to performance. This isn't a wishy washy Analytics team but one that measures results of projects and activities and is continually looking to add more value from what you deliver. You will be given first class training and support (e.g. the company is very technical, most managers and execs in analytics and Technology etc. can code and they will help you grow your skills) but also be expected to own your work - if you write a report/presentation then you will be expected to deliver it to the stakeholders - you won't be held back by the leadership in this environment but supported and encouraged to stretch yourself.

The role will comprise of most facets of Data and Analytics in 2019 (Machine Learning Techniques, Data Science principles, AI initiatives) and underlying this is data management/data integrity work which is at the heart of any more advanced work.

You will work with different business units, engage with various stakeholders and be regarded as someone who can help optimise the business. This is truly a high profile role within a fast-paced data driven business and has superb career growth opportunities on offer.

With projects and regular work and then ad-hoc queries to deal with this is a role where the ability to plan, organised and work to deadlines is critical.

If you are a recent graduate with a passion for Data and Analytics and you have the coding abilities and intellectual horse-power to excel in a high performing team then look no further. This is the role for you. Outstanding business with a great culture and the opportunity for you to learn from the very best. In addition to this my client is offering a very competitive starting salary and is known for rewarding the efforts of its people.

The mountains of data are large, but our data team is small, and we’re looking to change that.

Our product has grown by over 25 times in the last 2 years, and we now have 10s of millions of users generating enormous quantities of data every day. To help us fuel our future growth and help even more users, we need to better understand our data - this is where we need your help.

The Data Analytics team investigates and manages huge volumes of data in order to help our friends in other teams to build the right product. You’ll be coming into a diverse team of people who really do enjoy finding answers to the problems that the business and our users have. We can often be found chatting about all the latest trends in data and how we can apply them at Canva. We’re looking forward to growing the team and gaining a range of new perspectives and ideas on how we can do things better.

Role Responsibilities

Help us understand both Canva and our customers – we want you to be creative and insightful, rather than just throwing the usual metrics at the wall to see what sticks
Suggest, set up, and run interesting experiments that will actually move our metrics – when we push tests to 100% we want to actually see the bump in the relevant graph
Build and maintain dashboards for our product teams, and make them look really good – you don’t need to be a designer or have any design talent, you just need to want to build things that look cool
Use our giant databases to answer the sort of questions that sound really simple but turn out to be challenging (and fun!)
Help us extend data literacy and curiosity throughout the whole company

Required Skills & Experience

Experience with very large data sets — if you’re familiar with that sinking feeling that your computer doesn’t have quite enough RAM for what you’re trying to do, then you’ll be at home here
A grounding in mathematics / statistics and a bachelor’s degree in a STEM area is preferred; but not required
Strong competency with SQL; experience with big data SQL Query Engines like Presto, Hive, or Impala is a plus!
Experience wrangling and analyzing data using Python or R
Experience working with products would be a huge help – optimising AARRR funnels, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes
Strong communication skills – verbal and written – be able to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas
