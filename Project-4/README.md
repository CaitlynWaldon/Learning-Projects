### Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0, 1, 2 or 3). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project **requirements:** 

 Score | Expectations
 ----- | ------------
 **0** | _Did not complete. Try again._
 **1** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again_
 **2** | _Meets expectations._
 **3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_
